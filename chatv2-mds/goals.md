# Rebuilding the LLM playground 
The existing LLM playground works but there is a lot of tech debt. The tech debt stemmed from back when we were using Mastra, then did the migration over to using Vercel AI-SDK. The implementation is a mess, and we'd like to re-write the entire playground. This will help us better support MCP-UI and OpenAI apps SDK in the playground too. 

## Existing LLM playground 
To build a new playground, you have to understand some background with the existing playground. The existing playground has a frontend (`client/src/components/ChatTab.tsx`), a backend that runs the LLM and streams text (`server/routes/mcp/chat.ts`), and a `useChat` hook (`client/src/hooks/use-chat.ts`). The new playground will have the same structure, but without our custom hook, and using native Vercel ai-sdk functions instead of custom implementations.

Check out [our docs](https://docs.mcpjam.com/contributing/playground-architecture) in detail to understand the full implementation.

## What do we need to build 
We're rebuilding the LLM playground. Ideally it has the same exact behavior as the existing LLM playground, just with a cleaner implementation. We want to use the native functions in Vercel AI SDK. 

- [ ] Create a new tab, `ChatTabV2.tsx`. Feature flag it so we don't show it to prod yet.
- [ ] Create a new backend endpoint in the Hono server. See the streamText with Hono backend example. 
- [ ] Create the UI for chat. The UI should contain the `useChat` hook. We should also look at the possibility of using [Assistant UI](https://www.assistant-ui.com/docs/api-reference/integrations/vercel-ai-sdk#useverceluseassistantruntime) for chat UI. 
- [ ] Handle elicitation support in chat. 
- [ ] Implement MCP-UI and OpenAI apps SDK.
- [ ] Handle free chat. This involves work in the MCPJam backend. 
- [ ] Enforce human in the loop tool approvals (nice to have) 
- [ ] Have multiple chat sessions (nice to have)
