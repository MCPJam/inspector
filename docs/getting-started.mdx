## Quick start

Run the command in your terminal

    ```bash
    npx @mcpjam/inspector@latest
    ```

After installing the package, you should see a link to `localhost`. Open that link up to see the inspector. 

If you don't have Node.js installed, check out our [desktop app](https://mcpjam.com). 

## Connect to your first MCP server 
Click on "Add server" and connect to your first MCP server

```
npx -y @modelcontextprotocol/server-everything
```

</Frame>

Once you hit submit, you should see the connection status as "Connected". This page is your server connections page. You can connect to multiple MCP servers simulatenously on MCPJam.

<Info>
  `@modelcontextprotocol/server-everything` is the example server from Anthropic

## Test an MCP tool

Go to the "Tools" tab. You'll be able to see all of the MCP tools `server-everything` has. Tools tab lets you test individual tools with configured params. 

Try testing out the `add` tool and set params for `a` and `b`. Upon hitting "Execute", you should see the tool's return value on the bottom.
