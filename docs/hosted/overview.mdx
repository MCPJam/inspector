MCPJam Inspector is available as a hosted web app at [app.mcpjam.com](https://app.mcpjam.com). Connect to your remote MCP servers, test tools, build apps, and use the LLM playground — all from your browser without installing anything.

## Why use the hosted app?

- **No installation** — Open a browser and start testing.
- **Free LLM playground** — Chat with your MCP server using our free models at no cost.
- **Always up to date** — You're always on the latest version without running `npx @mcpjam/inspector@latest`.
- **Shareable** — Share server URLs with your team. Everyone can inspect the same server without local setup.

## Share your MCP server

Send a link to your MCP server or app the same way you'd share a Google Doc. Anyone with a MCPJam account who opens it can immediately start chatting with the server in the playground — right in their browser.

Try it yourself with the [Excalidraw MCP server](https://app.mcpjam.com/shared/excalidraw/mN4lJGfKanjpnBdZvE-lL):

## Quick start

1. Go to [app.mcpjam.com](https://app.mcpjam.com)
2. Click **Add server** and enter your MCP server's URL (must be HTTPS)
3. Choose your authentication method (None, Bearer Token, or OAuth 2.0)
4. Start inspecting tools, resources, and prompts

## What's different

The following features are not available in the hosted app. They are available when running MCPJam locally via [npx, Docker, or the desktop app](/installation).

### HTTPS only

The hosted app requires all MCP server connections to use **HTTPS**. If your server only supports HTTP, use the [local inspector](/installation) instead.

### No STDIO connections

STDIO servers are not available in the hosted version of MCPJam. Use SSE or Streamable HTTP transport instead.

### No tunneling

Tunneling exposes a local MCP server over HTTPS for remote access. Since the hosted app connects to already-remote servers, tunneling is not applicable.

### No skills

Skills are not yet available in the hosted app.

### No tasks

Tasks are not yet available in the hosted app.
