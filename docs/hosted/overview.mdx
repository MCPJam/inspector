MCPJam Inspector is available as a hosted web app at [app.mcpjam.com](https://app.mcpjam.com). Connect to your remote MCP servers, test tools, and use the LLM playground — all from your browser without installing anything.

## Why use the hosted app?

- **No installation** — No Node.js, Docker, or desktop app required. Open a browser and start testing.
- **Free LLM playground** — Chat with your MCP server using GPT-5, Claude Sonnet, and other frontier models at no cost.
- **Always up to date** — You're always on the latest version without running `npx @mcpjam/inspector@latest`.
- **Shareable** — Share server URLs with your team. Everyone can inspect the same server without local setup.

## Quick start

1. Go to [app.mcpjam.com](https://app.mcpjam.com)
2. Click **Add server** and enter your MCP server's URL (must be HTTPS)
3. Choose your authentication method (None, Bearer Token, or OAuth 2.0)
4. Start inspecting tools, resources, and prompts

<Warning>
  The hosted app only supports **HTTPS** server URLs. If your server runs on HTTP, use the [local inspector](/installation) instead, or deploy your server behind HTTPS.
</Warning>

## Available features

These features work the same way in the hosted app as they do locally:

| Feature | Description |
|---|---|
| **MCP Servers** | Connect to remote MCP servers over SSE or Streamable HTTP |
| **Tools** | Browse and execute MCP tools with custom parameters |
| **Resources** | List and read MCP resources and resource templates |
| **Prompts** | View and test MCP prompts |
| **LLM Playground** | Chat with your MCP server using free frontier models (GPT-5, Claude Sonnet, Gemini) |
| **App Builder** | Build and test ChatGPT apps and MCP apps with the widget emulator |
| **Views** | Render MCP app views inline |
| **OAuth Debugger** | Debug your server's OAuth implementation step by step |
| **Settings** | Configure LLM providers, themes, and preferences |

## What's different

### HTTPS only

The hosted app requires all MCP server connections to use **HTTPS**. HTTP URLs are rejected to prevent man-in-the-middle attacks when connecting over the public internet.

If your server only supports HTTP, you have two options:
- Use the [local inspector](/installation) instead
- Deploy your server behind an HTTPS reverse proxy or a platform that provides TLS (e.g., Railway, Vercel, Cloudflare)

### No STDIO connections

STDIO transport requires launching a local process on your machine. Since the hosted app runs in the cloud, it cannot start local processes. Use SSE or Streamable HTTP transport instead.

<Info>
  STDIO is available in the [local inspector](/installation) and [desktop app](https://github.com/MCPJam/inspector/releases).
</Info>

### No file upload or download

The hosted app cannot access your local filesystem. Features that involve reading or writing local files (such as uploading server configurations or downloading exports) are not available.

### No tunneling

Tunneling exposes a local MCP server over HTTPS for remote access. Since the hosted app connects to already-remote servers, tunneling is not applicable.

### LLM models

In the hosted app, the LLM playground uses MCPJam-provided models (GPT-5, Claude Sonnet, Gemini) for free. Custom API keys for third-party providers are not supported in hosted mode.

## Features not available

These features are only available in the local inspector:

| Feature | Reason |
|---|---|
| **Evals** | Requires local test execution and file system access |
| **Skills** | Local-only automation feature |
| **Tasks** | Task-augmented tool execution requires local process management |
| **Tracing** | Local debugging and trace collection |
