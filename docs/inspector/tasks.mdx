The Tasks tab provides a comprehensive interface for monitoring and managing background tasks created by MCP servers. Tasks allow tools, prompts, and other operations to run asynchronously while you continue working.

## Overview

MCP Tasks (spec 2025-11-25) enable servers to execute operations in the background, providing:

- **Asynchronous execution**: Long-running operations don't block your workflow
- **Progress tracking**: Real-time updates on task status and completion
- **Task management**: View, monitor, and cancel active tasks
- **Result retrieval**: Access completed task results when ready

## Task Lifecycle

Tasks progress through several states:

<Steps>
  <Step title="Working" icon="loader">
    Task is actively executing. Progress updates may be available.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Input Required" icon="alert-circle">
    Task needs user input to continue (elicitation).
  </Step>
  <Step title="Completed" icon="check-circle">
    Task finished successfully. Results are available.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Failed" icon="x-circle">
    Task encountered an error. Error details are available.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Cancelled" icon="slash">
    Task was cancelled by user or expired.
  </Step>
</Steps>

## Creating Tasks

### From Tools Tab

When executing a tool, you can run it as a background task:

1. Navigate to the **Tools** tab
2. Select a tool and configure parameters
3. Check the **Task** checkbox to execute as background task
4. (Optional) Set a **TTL** (time-to-live) in milliseconds
5. Click **Execute**

The tool will execute in the background, and you'll be redirected to the Tasks tab to monitor progress.

<Note>
  Some tools require task execution (marked with "Task required"). These tools
  automatically run as background tasks.
</Note>

### Task Options

- **TTL (Time-to-Live)**: Maximum time (in milliseconds) the task can run before expiring. Set to 0 for no expiration.
- **Server Capability**: Task execution is only available if the server declares `tasks.requests.tools.call` capability.

## Monitoring Tasks

### Task List

The left panel shows all active and completed tasks:

- **Status indicator**: Visual icon showing current task state
- **Task name**: Tool or operation name
- **Relative time**: When the task was created
- **Progress bar**: For working tasks with known progress

### Task Details

Select a task to view detailed information:

- **Task ID**: Unique identifier for the task
- **Status**: Current state with status message
- **Timestamps**: Creation and last update times
- **TTL**: Time-to-live configuration
- **Poll Interval**: Server-suggested refresh rate
- **Progress**: Real-time progress updates (when available)

### Task Results

Completed or failed tasks display their results:

- **Completed tasks**: Show the operation result (e.g., tool output)
- **Failed tasks**: Display error information
- **Input required**: Show pending elicitation requests

## Auto-Refresh

The Tasks tab includes intelligent auto-refresh:

- **Automatic activation**: Enables when tasks are actively running
- **Server-suggested intervals**: Respects poll intervals from the server
- **Manual override**: Adjust refresh rate or disable auto-refresh
- **Minimum interval**: 500ms to prevent excessive polling

<Tip>
  The poll interval input is pre-filled with the server's suggested rate. You
  can override this value if needed.
</Tip>

## Task Management

### Cancelling Tasks

Cancel a running task:

1. Select the task from the list
2. Click **Cancel Task** in the task details header
3. The task status will update to "cancelled"

<Warning>
  Task cancellation is only available if the server declares `tasks.cancel`
  capability. Not all servers support cancellation.
</Warning>

### Clearing Tasks

Remove all tasks from the list:

1. Click the trash icon in the Tasks header
2. All tasks are dismissed and removed from view
3. Dismissed tasks won't reappear after refresh

## Progress Tracking

### Determinate Progress

When a task reports total progress:

- Progress bar shows completion percentage
- Current/total values displayed (e.g., "5/10")
- Optional progress message from the server

### Indeterminate Progress

When total progress is unknown:

- Animated progress indicator shows activity
- Elapsed time displayed
- Status message updates from server

## Elicitation Handling

Tasks may request user input during execution:

1. Task status changes to "input_required"
2. Elicitation dialog appears with the request
3. Provide required input or decline
4. Task continues execution after response

<Info>
  Elicitations related to tasks include the task ID in metadata, allowing you to
  track which task needs input.
</Info>

## Server Capabilities

The Tasks tab adapts based on server capabilities:

- **tasks.requests.tools.call**: Server supports task-augmented tool calls
- **tasks.list**: Server supports listing tasks
- **tasks.cancel**: Server supports task cancellation

If a server doesn't support tasks, the task execution option won't appear in the Tools tab.

    Execute time-consuming operations as tasks to avoid blocking the UI.

## Troubleshooting

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="Task execution option not available">
    **Cause**: Server doesn't support task-augmented requests.
    
    **Solution**: Verify the server declares `tasks.requests.tools.call` capability. Check server documentation for task support.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Tasks not appearing in list">
    **Cause**: Server may not support `tasks/list` operation.
    
    **Solution**: Tasks created during your session are tracked locally and will appear even if the server doesn't support listing. Previously created tasks may not be visible.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Cannot cancel task">
    **Cause**: Server doesn't support task cancellation.
    
    **Solution**: Wait for the task to complete or expire based on its TTL. Not all servers implement cancellation.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Task stuck in 'working' state">
    **Cause**: Server may have crashed or lost connection.
    
    **Solution**: Check server logs and connection status. The task will eventually expire based on its TTL.
  </Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>

## Technical Details

### MCP Tasks Specification

Tasks follow the MCP Tasks specification (2025-11-25):

- **Task augmentation**: Requests include `task` field with options
- **Progress notifications**: Servers send `notifications/progress` events
- **Status updates**: Servers may send `notifications/tasks/status` events
- **Result retrieval**: `tasks/result` returns the underlying operation result

### Local Task Tracking

Inspector tracks tasks locally to support servers that don't persist task lists:

- Tasks created during your session are stored in browser localStorage
- Dismissed tasks are filtered from the view
- Maximum 50 tasks tracked per server
- Stale entries cleaned up automatically
