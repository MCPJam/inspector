## Getting Started

Thank you for considering contributing to MCPJam Inspector! It's people like you that make the open source community such a great place.

Before you get started, please consider giving the project a star ‚≠ê. It helps grow the project and gives your contributions more recognition.

Also join our [Discord channel](https://discord.com/invite/JEnDtz8X6z). That's where the community and other open source contributors communicate.

## Finding Issues to Work On

1. **Browse our issues** in the [issues tab](https://github.com/MCPJam/inspector/issues)
2. **Look for starter labels**:
   - `good first issue` - Great for newcomers
   - `very easy` - Low commitment tasks
3. **Claim an issue**:
   - Comment on the issue you want to work on
   - Tag `@matteo8p` in your comment
   - Assign yourself to the issue
   - This helps avoid multiple contributors working on the same issue
