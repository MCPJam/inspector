We are working on a GUI for MCP evals. Feature is a work in progress and incomplete. We highly recommend users use the MCPJam Evals CLI for now. 

## MCP Evals CLI

Run MCP evals via CLI. We are working on maturing the CLI before building our GUI.

## How MCP E2E Testing Works

E2E testing simulates real user workflows by testing complete chains of interactions. For MCP servers, this means testing how they work when used by actual LLMs and agents in real-world scenarios.

### Why Test MCP Servers Differently?

- **APIs** are consumed by other APIs or web clients
- **MCP servers** are consumed by LLMs and agents (like Claude Desktop, Cursor)
- We need to simulate the actual user environment where MCP servers operate

### How It Works

1. **Setup**: Connect your MCP server to a testing agent
2. **Simulate**: Configure the agent to behave like a real user (e.g., Claude Desktop)
3. **Test**: Have the agent run realistic user queries
4. **Verify**: Check the agent's trace to confirm correct tool usage

### Example: PayPal MCP Test

```
1. Connect PayPal MCP server to testing agent
2. Ask: "Create a refund for order ID 412"
3. Agent runs the query using MCP tools
4. Verify: Did it call create_refund tool successfully?
```

An LLM judge can analyze the agent's trace to determine if the test passed.
