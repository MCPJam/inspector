## Logs

View all messages being sent back and forth between MCPJam and your MCP server. We're working on building support to view all JSON-RPC messages. Tracing message levels are `ERROR`, `WARNING`, and `TRACE`.

## Setting log levels

You can configure the logging verbosity for each connected MCP server. This follows the [MCP logging specification](https://modelcontextprotocol.info/specification/draft/server/utilities/logging/).

To set a log level:

1. Open the Logger panel
2. Select a connected server from the dropdown
3. Choose a log level from the available options
4. Click **Apply**

Available log levels (from most to least verbose):

- `debug` - Detailed debugging information
- `info` - General informational messages
- `notice` - Normal but significant events
- `warning` - Warning conditions
- `error` - Error conditions
- `critical` - Critical conditions
- `alert` - Action must be taken immediately
- `emergency` - System is unusable
