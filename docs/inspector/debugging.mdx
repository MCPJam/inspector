## Tracing tab

The **Tracing** tab provides a dedicated view for monitoring all JSON-RPC messages between the Inspector and your MCP servers. Access it from the sidebar under "Others".

Use the Tracing tab to:
- View all JSON-RPC requests and responses in real-time
- Filter logs by level (`ERROR`, `WARN`, `INFO`, `DEBUG`, `TRACE`)
- Filter by server when multiple servers are connected
- Search through log messages

## JSON-RPC panel

The Servers and Chat tabs include a collapsible JSON-RPC panel on the right side. Toggle the panel visibility using the panel icon in the toolbar. Your preference is saved across sessions.
