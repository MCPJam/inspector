Guided OAuth lets you test your OAuth implementation step-by-step. The feature works functionally, but we're actively making improvements. The guided OAuth testing is compliant to [MCP OAuth](https://modelcontextprotocol.io/specification/draft/basic/authorization).

## OAuth Steps

1. Metadata Discovery
2. Client Registration
3. Request & fetch auth code
4. Request access token

## Debugger Views

The OAuth debugger provides two views to help you understand and troubleshoot your OAuth flow:

### Guide View

The default view organizes all activity by OAuth step. Each step shows:
- Educational content explaining what to pay attention to
- Tips for common issues
- All HTTP requests and logs for that specific step
- Step status indicators (pending, in progress, completed, error)

This view is ideal for understanding the OAuth flow and identifying which step is causing issues.

### Raw View

The raw view displays all HTTP requests and info logs in chronological order, showing:
- Exact timestamps for each event
- Request methods and response status codes
- Step context for each entry
- All entries expanded by default for quick inspection

This view is useful for debugging timing issues, understanding the exact sequence of events, and inspecting raw request/response data.
