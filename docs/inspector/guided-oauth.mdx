Guided OAuth lets you test your OAuth implementation step-by-step. The feature works functionally, but we're actively making improvements. The guided OAuth testing is compliant to [MCP OAuth](https://modelcontextprotocol.io/specification/draft/basic/authorization).

## Interactive Flow Guide

The OAuth debugger provides an interactive guide that walks you through each step of the OAuth flow:

- **Step-by-step breakdown**: Each step shows its title, description, and current status (Pending, In Progress, or Complete)
- **Educational hints**: Learn what to pay attention to at each step with contextual "teachable moments"
- **Tips and best practices**: Get helpful tips for common issues and configuration recommendations
- **Synchronized diagram**: Click "Show in diagram" to focus on a specific step in the sequence diagram
- **HTTP request/response logs**: Inspect the actual HTTP traffic for each step, including headers and body content
- **Console output**: View detailed JSON data for metadata, tokens, and other OAuth artifacts

The guide automatically scrolls to show the latest activity and highlights the current step, making it easy to follow along as the flow progresses.

## OAuth Steps

1. Metadata Discovery
2. Client Registration
